# Crylib

**Crylib** is a lightweight and modern **C++ game and graphics library** built for **simplicity, speed, and modularity**.  
It’s designed for both **game development** and **general-purpose rendering or software**, offering a flexible and efficient framework for building real-time applications with ease.

Crylib provides a unified API for rendering, animation, audio, and asset management, while maintaining a minimal setup and fast runtime performance.
